            <h1>Invent & Simplify: Redefining the Feedback Loop</h1>
        </header>

            <p class="highlight-box">
                "Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify.
                They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by 'not invented
                here'."
            </p>

            <p>
                When we think of innovation, we often think of brand new products. But true leadership involves killing
                bad products and simplifying new processes, not just "inventing" for the sake of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is a story about a time I had to invent a simpler solution to a complex problem.
            </p>

            <h2>The Situation</h2>
            <p>
                When I was a Product Owner for the IT Performance Dashboard, my team owned the full analytics
                lifecycle—ETL, business logic, and Power BI dashboards. One recurring challenge was finalizing dashboard
                visualizations before production. Visualization was the final customer experience, so getting it wrong
                meant expensive rework.
            </p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Our goal was to validate dashboard design quickly, build stakeholder alignment, and reduce waste before
                production release—but the existing process wasn't working. The standard approach was sprint-review
                feedback sessions, which created three major issues:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Small sample size:</strong> Only 4–5 stakeholders attended reviews, so feedback wasn’t
                    representative.</li>
                <li><strong>Fragmented experience:</strong> Feedback focused on individual screens, not the end-to-end
                    user journey (drill-downs, linked views).</li>
                <li><strong>No consensus:</strong> Stakeholders gave conflicting opinions asynchronously, often after
                    missing reviews, leading to repeated redesigns.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite this inefficiency, the process had become "accepted" and no one questioned it.</p>

            <h2>Action: Invent & Simplify</h2>
            <p>I stepped back and asked: <em>"Why are we treating visualization feedback like code reviews instead of
                    product experience validation?"</em></p>

            <h3>1. External Thinking & Invention</h3>
            <p>I researched alternative approaches and discovered a Power BI integration within Microsoft Teams that
                allowed dashboards to be published directly to a team workspace—creating a near-production experience
                without a formal app release.</p>

            <h3>2. Simplification with Data-Backed Decisions</h3>
            <p>Before proposing the change, I worked with the dev manager to quantify effort:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>App-based releases required ~12 story points (~60 hours) per iteration.</li>
                <li>Estimated recurring cost: ~₹15,000/year per dashboard for updates and re-releases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With clear cost and effort visibility, I presented a proposal to leadership to pivot away from early app
                releases, which was approved immediately.</p>

            <h3>3. Scalable Feedback Mechanism</h3>
            <p>Instead of sprint-review discussions, dashboards were published directly to Teams where stakeholders
                experienced full drill-downs and linked views. I introduced polls for design variants and a shared Excel
                sheet for structured feedback. Consolidated results were published transparently, and explicit sign-off
                was taken on the final direction.</p>

            <h2>The Result</h2>
            <div class="stat-grid">
                <div class="stat-card">
                    <span class="stat-value">27%</span>
                    <span class="stat-label">Reduction in Rework</span>
                </div>
                <div class="stat-card">
                    <span class="stat-value">60+</span>
                    <span class="stat-label">Hours Saved / Iteration</span>
                </div>
                <div class="stat-card">
                    <span class="stat-value">100%</span>
                    <span class="stat-label">Faster Engagement</span>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                We reduced rework by 27% (12 out of 45 planned stories eliminated), cut weeks of development time, and
                avoided hundreds of email threads. The process was later adopted across the entire Data & Analytics
                group and shared as a best practice via the monthly newsletter.
            </p>

            <h2>Why This Was Innovative</h2>
            <p>
                This wasn’t about new technology—it was about rethinking the feedback model. We killed an inefficient
                "standard" process, simplified release cycles, and treated dashboards as products, not deliverables. It
                allowed us to move faster, cheaper, and with far less friction—while improving customer experience.
