INVENT AND SIMPLIFY

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

Think about killing bad products and simplifying new products, not just “inventing”! Always keeping some room open for exploration.

Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem. Tell me about the most innovative project you’ve done. Why did you think it was
innovative?

Situation
When I was a Product Owner for the IT Performance Dashboard, my team owned the full analytics lifecycle—ETL, business logic, and Power BI dashboards.
 One recurring challenge was finalizing dashboard visualizations before production. Visualization was the final customer experience, so getting it wrong meant expensive rework.
Task
Our goal was to validate dashboard design quickly, build stakeholder alignment, and reduce waste before production release—but the existing process wasn’t working.
Problem
The standard approach was sprint-review feedback sessions, but this created three major issues:
Small sample size – Only 4–5 stakeholders attended reviews, so feedback wasn’t representative.


Fragmented experience – Feedback focused on individual screens, not the end-to-end user journey (drill-downs, linked views).


No consensus – Stakeholders gave conflicting opinions asynchronously, often after missing reviews, leading to repeated redesigns.


Despite this inefficiency, the process had become “accepted” and no one questioned it.

Action (Invent & Simplify)
I stepped back and asked: “Why are we treating visualization feedback like code reviews instead of product experience validation?”
P1 – External thinking & invention
 I researched alternative approaches and discovered a Power BI integration within Microsoft Teams that allowed dashboards to be published directly to a team workspace—creating a near-production experience without a formal app release.
P2 – Simplification with data-backed decision making
 Before proposing the change, I worked with the dev manager to quantify effort:
App-based releases required ~12 story points (~60 hours) per iteration


Estimated recurring cost: ~₹15,000/year per dashboard for updates and re-releases


With clear cost and effort visibility, I presented a proposal to leadership to pivot away from early app releases, which was approved immediately.
P3 – Scalable feedback mechanism
 Instead of sprint-review discussions:
Dashboards were published directly to Teams


Stakeholders experienced full drill-downs and linked views


I introduced polls for design variants


A shared Excel sheet captured structured feedback


Consolidated results were published transparently, and explicit sign-off was taken on the final direction


This forced alignment in one channel and pushed business owners to resolve disagreements collaboratively.



Result
Reduced rework by 27% (12 out of 45 planned stories eliminated)


Cut weeks of development time and hundreds of email threads


Faster stakeholder engagement—users started interacting with dashboards earlier in the lifecycle


Higher satisfaction due to clarity and transparency


The process was later adopted across the entire Data & Analytics group and shared as a best practice via the monthly newsletter



Why This Was Innovative
This wasn’t about new technology—it was about rethinking the feedback model:
We killed an inefficient “standard” process


Simplified release cycles


Treated dashboards as products, not deliverables


Used existing tools in a new, scalable way


It allowed us to move faster, cheaper, and with far less friction—while improving customer experience.
